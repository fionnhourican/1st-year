					<p>In Ty (2017), I worked in <a href=https://www.ericsson.com/en>Ericcson</a>. Here I learned how to make a website using basic Html and CSS. I also learned how
					telecommunications work and studied how an autonomous car would work using 5G. I worked with information providers in 2017, where 
					I designed and made websites for various clients. I also worked in Abbots in Longford in 2017. Here I repaired machines on the    
					factory floor. I currently work with CHCL on the weekends. I've been part of the company since 2016. This is a  
					construction company whom I labour for. I am also a bricklayer as the money pays well.</p>

 <p>My biggest passion and hobby is <a href=https://www.gaa.ie//>Gaelic football</a>. I've played football since I was six years old and I am still playing now at nine-teen. I

	 which are in the 13-aside division. I also play with the Longford u20 county team, I made my debut with Longford u20 in the 2021 Leinster       
	 championship against Louth where I scored a point and set up 2-3. I currently play with the DCU Glasnevin freshers team and made my debut in the
	 freshers league against St pats Dcu in a local rivalry where I played center halfback leading the team to the win.</p>
